;The reason they may lead to different answers is that when operations are performed upon intervals the error magnifies.
;Therefore the answer becomes imprecise, and when this answer is used further on the imprecision increases yielding a final
;answer that has a higher error percentage than would be expected.
;This is what happens in (par1 r1 r2). The imprecision increases each the intervals are used to calculate intermediary values.
